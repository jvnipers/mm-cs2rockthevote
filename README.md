# CS2 Rock The Vote

CS2 rtv plugin using Metamod: Source

## Usage

### Requirements

* CS2 Dedicated Server
* [Metamod: Source 2.0](https://www.metamodsource.net/downloads.php?branch=dev)
* (Optional\*) [mm-cs2admin](https://github.com/FemboyKZ/mm-cs2admin)
* (Optional\*\*) [mm-cs2whitelist](https://github.com/FemboyKZ/mm-cs2whitelist)

\*Admin commands like `reloadrtv` and `mapmenu` will not work without it.

\*\*When loaded alongside cs2rtv, only players that are whitelisted can use !rtv.
This stops players from spamming it on join before getting kicked to trigger a vote maliciously.

### Install

1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/FemboyKZ/mm-cs2rockthevote/releases/latest) and extract it in your server's root folder (`/game/csgo/`).
2. Configure the plugin in `core.cfg` and the maplist in `maplist.txt`
